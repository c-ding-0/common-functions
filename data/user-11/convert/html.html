<p>Being able to use references and citations is very nice! I just had two questions: is tikz-cd support planned or included already? Right now I get “Unknown environment ‘tikzcd’,” and uploading a TeX file with tikz-cd in it just returns an error. Also, I seem to remember some Wordpress plugins like QuickLaTeX which let you set your own preamble. Perhaps it’s more effort than it’s worth, but is it possible to integrate in something along those lines?</p>
